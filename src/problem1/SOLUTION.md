TSLA Order Processing Solution
Overview
This solution implements a bash script for processing Tesla (TSLA) stock sell orders from a transaction log. The script handles order processing, error management, and generates detailed reports.

Implementation Details
Core Components
Main Script (process-tsla-orders.sh)
Bash
Insert in terminal

#!/bin/bash

readonly LOG_FILE="transaction-log.txt"
readonly OUTPUT_FILE="output.txt"
readonly API_ENDPOINT="https://api.example.com/orders"
Key Functions
1. Logging Function
Bash
Insert in terminal

log_message() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1"
}
2. Order Processing
Bash
Insert in terminal

process_order() {
    local order_id=$1
    local response
    
    response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" "$API_ENDPOINT/$order_id")
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "$response" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
        return 0
    fi
    return 1
}
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Bash shell environment
jq for JSON processing
curl for API requests
Installation
Bash
Insert in terminal

# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install jq curl

# Verify installation
jq --version
curl --version

# Set execution permissions
chmod +x process-tsla-orders.sh
Usage
Create transaction-log.txt with order data:
Json
Insert code

{
  "symbol": "TSLA",
  "side": "sell",
  "order_id": "12345"
}
Run the script:
Bash
Insert in terminal

./process-tsla-orders.sh
Output Format
Console Output
Starting TSLA sell order processing at 2024-01-20 10:30:15
Processing order 12345... ✓ SUCCESS (Status: 200)
Processing order 12346... ✗ FAILED (Status: 404)

=== Summary ===
Total TSLA sell orders processed: 2
Successful requests: 1
Failed requests: 1
Output File
The script generates output.txt containing detailed response data for each processed order.

Error Handling
Failed API requests are logged and counted
Script maintains execution even if individual orders fail
Detailed error information is saved to output file
Performance Considerations
Processes orders sequentially for reliability
Maintains a single output file for all responses
Uses efficient bash built-ins where possible
Limitations
Single-threaded processing
Requires valid JSON format in transaction log
Depends on external API availability
Future Improvements
Add parallel processing for better performance
Implement retry mechanism for failed requests
Add configuration file for API endpoints and settings
Enhanced error reporting and logging
Add support for multiple stock symbols
Testing
To test the script:

Ensure all dependencies are installed
Create a test transaction log
Run the script
Verify output file and console messages

## 1.AWS Shield
Why Used:
```
Provides DDoS protection to safeguard applications against volumetric and sophisticated network attacks.
Automatically integrates with AWS services such as ALB, CloudFront, and Route 53 for protection without additional configuration.
```
Alternatives Considered:
```
AWS WAF: Can provide application layer security, but it does not fully protect against large-scale DDoS attacks.
Third-party solutions (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai Kona Site Defender): These offer advanced security but introduce external dependencies.
```
